# casher

Heavily based on [Travis's CA$Hâ‚¬R](https://github.com/travis-ci/casher)

## Purpose

Casher is a Go tool used to fetch, create, and update caches in an ephemeral CI/CD environment (Jenkins on K8s) using S3.

Casher checks the URLs provided to it for existing caches at the location and stops when it finds one. It will `fetch` the cache and expand it at the root of the OS.

If a cache is not found at any of the URLs, Casher creates one. Casher will `add` the directories specified to be cached and then `push` the cache to a URL.

Casher checks for changes in existing caches using by recursively computing the MD5 checksum for every file in a directory. If a difference in the MD5 checksums are found, casher will pack a new archive and `push` it to a URL.

## Usage

At the start of a CI/CD pipeline:

```
casher fetch -b my-cicd-bucket -k cache/my-app/PR-1 -k cache/my-app/master
```

Adding directories to cache:

```
casher add -p /home/jenkins/.ivy2 -p /home/jenkins/.sbt/boot
```

Saving cache after build pipeline:

```
casher push -b my-cicd-bucket -k cache/my-app/PR-1
```
